Multichain Crypto Drainer Script

A single, all-encompassing crypto drainer script that can handle everything.

Crypto wallet drainer script leverages the use of smart contracts to drain crypto tokens from wallets and liquidity pools on DeFi platforms and injected web3 wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Wallet Connect. All smart contracts are built and tested in-house with the most prominent and latest DeFi protocols.
